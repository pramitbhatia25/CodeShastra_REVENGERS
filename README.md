## Tagline
Listen, Sing and Amuse yourself with Musical NFTs

## Problem it solves
It is a mobile-first platform for buying and selling musical NFTs customised differently for both users and artists. Users can pay with ETH Wallet to buy music whereas Artists can also buy other NFTs but also sell their own piece of art with a smooth and easy process provided by our platform. It also has a search feature for users to search if their favourite track is on list for them to make it theirs with unique smart contract NFTs stored on ETH Blockchain.

## Challenges we ran into
The biggest challenge was there were less ethereum in test network so deployment was not easy.
Due to high gas fees there were transaction error which was difficult to tackle.
It was difficult to integrate Blockchain with App .
Data integration with Firebase was a challenge as fetching was not a easy task.
Customized data was to be created since NFT are unique.
Creating unique pages for both artists and users was a tedious task.
